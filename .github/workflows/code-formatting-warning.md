Thanks for opening this issue! Based on our automated check, it seems that your post contains some code but it does not use [code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks) to format it.
          
Please double-check your post and revise it if necessary. To employ syntax highlighting, it's recommended to use code blocks with triple backticks, e.g.:
````
```sql
SELECT ...
```
````
If this is a false positive, feel free to disregard this comment.

m/10002008-charly,Fresh,"Imagine the CleanFlicks version of 'Love Story,' with Ali MacGraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes."
m/10004684-malevolence,Fresh,"The performances are better than one might expect from a cast of first-timers and lightly employed professionals, and Mena's characters rarely do the sort of spectacularly stupid things that provoke derisive laughter from seasoned horror-moviegoers."
m/10002008-charly,Fresh,The romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be.
m/0878835,Fresh,"Like Holofcener's previous pictures, Please Give derives its narrative energy less from a series of plotted incidents than from its keenly observed interplay of clashing personality tics and worldviews."
m/0878835,Fresh,"Keener, Peet and Hall all shine as women plagued with self-doubt who respond to those insecurities in strikingly different ways."
m/10004684-malevolence,Rotten,Stevan Mena's debut film carves up body after body in a ritual homage to the serial-killer genre.
m/10004684-malevolence,Fresh,The acting and dialogue is as silly as the potato sack the killer wears on his head.
m/10002008-charly,Rotten,Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions.
m/0878835,Fresh,"A muted, almost Rohmer-like moral tale that doesn't quite dive deeply enough into its several characters."
